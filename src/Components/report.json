            "content": "Healthcare workers (HCW) are exposed to occupational hazard of sharp injuries, commonly referred to as needle stick injuries. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that of the 35 million health-care workers, two million experience percutaneous exposure to infectious diseases each year. According to Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia, needle stick injury was the major cause of injuries among the MOH personnel which contributes to a total of 74.9% of all injuries in 2005. Vacuum extraction tube system was reported to be a safer option than using hypordermic needle and syringe. The system eliminates blood transfer and allows numerous blood samples to be collected through single venepuncture. Vacutainer system is a type of vacuum extraction tube system specifically designed for the collection of single or multiple blood samples under closed conditions. Vacuum extraction tube systems are widely available in most well-resourced countries. The system has been reported to reduce needle stick injuries in HCW. However, if the system is not correctly used, it may create risk for needle stick injuries to the HCW. Therefore, this systematic review was requested by the Medical and Endocrinology Consultant, Hospital Ipoh to evaluate safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of needleless Vacutainer system for blood collection."

        "content": "The evidence suggested that administration of SDR-PEP to leprosy contacts was effective in reducing the clinical development of the disease. The SDR-PEP gave a protection effect of 56.5% in leprosy contacts after two years, 34.9% after four years, and no additional effect after six years. Combination of SDR-PEP with childhood BCG vaccine showed a protection effect of 80% against leprosy after two years. Modeling studies on long-term effectiveness suggested that combinations of SDR-LPEP with systematic contact tracing or blanket approach were effective strategies in reducing the risk of developing leprosy. There were no serious adverse events and safety issues reported in the included studies. The SDR-PEP was shown to be cost-effective in India and Bangladesh, with benefit depending on the extent which disability can be prevented and different contacts level.  Integration of SDR-PEP and systematic contact tracing into leprosy control programme could potentially accelerate the interruption of leprosy transmission. The implementations of both interventions are feasible, generally safe, and well accepted by leprosy patients, their closed contacts and healthcare workers. "
